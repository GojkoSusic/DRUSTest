# DRUSTest

This is test repository, which will be used for DRUS subject.

STEP 1
In this step I added two console application and one class library. Two console applications represent two meteo stations, in solution MeteoStationGacko and
MeteoStationTrebinje. Class library in solution has name Common. In both meteo station I implemented logic for sending temperature and humidity data(temperature data every 1 sec and humidity data every 6 sec). In Common class library I keep common classes and interfaces which I use through the solution. In ScadaService console aplication I implemented server logic for accepting and displaying data sent from meteo stations.
